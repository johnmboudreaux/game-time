# Brick City / Game-Time

A simple app to break bricks and kill time. It has multiple levels ihn which the difficulty increases by making the board smaller, the ball velocity increase and the amount of bricks to break increases. 

If you would like to try it just clone down this repo, npm install, npm start and go to your localhost:3000. It only has 3 levels so don't buckle in and get comfy:)
